  name: string,              // Required
  detailedName: string,      // Optional
  timeZone: string,          // Required, dropdown selection
  cityId: string,            // Required, linked to City model
  address: {                 // Optional embedded object
    street: string,
    postalCode: string,
    cityName: string,
    countryName: string,
    regionCode: string
  },
  geoCode: {                 // Optional embedded object
    latitude: number,        // -90 to 90
    longitude: number        // -180 to 180
  }
}
```

## Redux Integration

### Thunks Used
- `createAirport` - Create new airport
- `updateAirport` - Update existing airport
- `deleteAirport` - Delete airport
- `listAllAirports` - Fetch all airports
- `getAirportByIataCode` - Validate IATA code uniqueness
- `getAllCities` - Populate city dropdown

### State Management
- Direct Redux dispatch (no custom hooks)
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Proper loading states and error handling

## Validation Schema (Yup)

```javascript
{
  iataCode: Yup.string()
    .length(3, 'IATA code must be exactly 3 characters')
    .matches(/^[A-Z]{3}$/, 'IATA code must contain only uppercase letters')
    .required('IATA code is required'),

  name: Yup.string()
    .min(2, 'Airport name must be at least 2 characters')
    .max(200, 'Airport name must be less than 200 characters')
    .required('Airport name is required'),

  // ... additional validation rules
}
```

## UI/UX Features

### Search & Filtering
