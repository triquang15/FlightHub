# Flight Management Route Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **FlightCard Component Misuse**
**Problem**: The `FlightCard` component was being used incorrectly in `AirlineRoutes.jsx`. It was receiving props meant for a flight management container instead of individual flight data.

**Solution**:
- Created a new `FlightManagement.jsx` component that properly handles flight list management
- Updated `AirlineRoutes.jsx` to use `FlightManagement` instead of `FlightCard` directly
- `FlightCard` now receives individual flight objects as intended

### 2. **Missing Filtered Flights State**
**Problem**: The `filteredFlights` state was commented out, causing flights filtering to not work properly.

**Solution**:
- Restored `filteredFlights` state in `AirlineDashboard.jsx`
- Fixed the useEffect dependency to properly filter flights based on search criteria
- Added null safety checks for flight object properties

### 3. **Redux Integration Issues**
**Problem**: Flight CRUD operations were using local state instead of Redux actions.

**Solution**:
- Updated `handleSaveFlight` to use Redux thunks (`createFlight`, `updateFlight`)
- Added proper error handling for async operations
- Integrated `deleteFlight` action in the new `FlightManagement` component
- Added `getAllFlights` dispatch on component mount

### 4. **Dashboard Stats Calculation**
**Problem**: Dashboard statistics were not handling null/undefined values properly.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped `dashboardStats` in `useMemo` for better performance
- Added null safety checks for all calculations
- Proper handling of empty flight arrays

## New Component: FlightManagement.jsx

### Features:
- ✅ **Search & Filter**: Real-time search across flight details
- ✅ **Status Filtering**: Filter by flight status (Active, Delayed, etc.)
- ✅ **Route Filtering**: Filter by departure/arrival airports
- ✅ **View Modes**: Grid and list view options
- ✅ **Redux Integration**: Uses Redux thunks for all CRUD operations
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- ✅ **Empty States**: Proper handling when no flights exist

### Props:
```javascript
{
  flights: Array,           // Flight data from Redux
  statusFilter: String,     // Current status filter
  setStatusFilter: Function,// Update status filter
  routeFilter: String,      // Current route filter
  setRouteFilter: Function, // Update route filter
  dateFilter: String,       // Current date filter
  setDateFilter: Function,  // Update date filter
  showFlightForm: Boolean,  // Modal state
  setShowFlightForm: Function, // Modal control
  editingFlight: Object,    // Flight being edited
  setEditingFlight: Function // Update editing flight
}
```

## Fixed Routes

### Before:
```javascript
// ❌ Wrong usage
<FlightCard
  flights={filteredFlights}           // Multiple flights
  statusFilter={statusFilter}
  setStatusFilter={setStatusFilter}
  // ... other container props
/>
```

### After:
```javascript
// ✅ Correct usage
<FlightManagement
  flights={filteredFlights}           // Proper container component
  statusFilter={statusFilter}
  setStatusFilter={setStatusFilter}
  // ... other container props
/>

// FlightCard now receives individual flights:
{filteredFlights.map(flight => (
  <FlightCard
    key={flight.id}
    flight={flight}                    // Single flight object
    onEdit={handleEditFlight}
    onDelete={handleDeleteFlight}
  />
))}
```

## File Changes Made:

1. **Created**: `FlightManagement.jsx` - New container component
2. **Updated**: `AirlineRoutes.jsx` - Fixed component usage
3. **Updated**: `AirlineDashboard.jsx` - Fixed Redux integration and state management
4. **Enhanced**: Error handling and null safety throughout

## Testing Status:
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Proper Redux integration
- ✅ Flight CRUD operations working
- ✅ Search and filtering functional
- ✅ Responsive design implemented

## Navigation:
The flight management is now accessible at `/airline/flights` with full functionality for:
- Viewing flights in grid/list modes
- Searching and filtering flights
- Adding new flights
- Editing existing flights
- Deleting flights
- Real-time status updates
