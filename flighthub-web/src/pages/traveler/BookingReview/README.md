3. **Add-ons** - Seat & Meal selection
4. **Protection Plans** - Flexibility add-ons & Travel insurance
5. **Policies** - Cancellation & Date change rules

## Data Flow

### Parent to Child (Props)
```javascript
BookingReview (Parent)
├── passengerCount → TravellerDetailsForm
├── flightData → FlightDetailsOverview
├── seatsData → SeatSelection
├── mealsData → MealSelection
├── fareData → FareSummaryCard
└── ... (other data)
```

### Child to Parent (Callbacks)
```javascript
TravellerDetailsForm → onTravellerDataChange(data)
SeatSelection → onSelectSeat(seat)
MealSelection → onSelectMeal(meals)
FareSummaryCard → onProceedToPayment()
```

## Mock Data Structure

### Passenger Count
```javascript
mockFareData.totalPassengers = 1 // Can be 1-9
```

### Traveller Data (Generated)
```javascript
{
  id: 0,
  type: 'Adult',
  title: 'Mr',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  gender: 'Male',
  dob: '1990-01-01',
  nationality: 'Indian',
  // First passenger only
  email: 'john@example.com',
  phone: '9876543210',
  countryCode: '+91'
}
```

## Validation Logic

### Before Payment Validation
```javascript
✓ All passengers must have: title, firstName, lastName, gender
✓ Primary passenger must have: email, phone
✓ Shows specific alert messages for missing data
```

## Installation & Setup

### Dependencies
All required dependencies are in `package.json`:
- `framer-motion`: ^11.18.2 ✓
- `lucide-react`: ^0.539.0 ✓
- `react-router-dom`: ^7.8.1 ✓

### Run the Project
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Customization

### Change Passenger Count
```javascript
// In BookingReview.jsx
const passengerCount = 2; // Change to your desired count
```

### Modify Form Fields
Edit `TravellerDetailsForm.jsx` to add/remove fields:
```javascript
// Add new field
<div>
  <label>Passport Number</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    value={passenger.passportNumber}
    onChange={(e) => handleInputChange(index, 'passportNumber', e.target.value)}
  />
</div>
```

### Customize Validation
Update validation in `BookingReview.jsx`:
```javascript
const isAllTravellersComplete = travellerData.every(t =>
  t.title && t.firstName && t.lastName && t.gender && t.passportNumber
);
```

## Responsive Design

### Desktop (lg and above)
- Two-column layout (2/3 left, 1/3 right)
- Sticky fare summary sidebar
- All sections visible

### Mobile
- Single column stacked layout
- Sticky bottom bar with total and CTA
- Collapsible sections for better UX

## Key Differences from Original Design

| Original | New (MakeMyTrip Style) |
|----------|----------------------|
| Progress stepper | Section-based layout |
| Steps: Review → Payment | All in one page |
| Separate seat/meal pages | Integrated sections |
| Generic structure | Travel booking optimized |
| No traveller forms | Dynamic passenger forms |

## Page Flow (User Journey)

1. User lands on page with selected flight
2. Reviews flight summary
3. **Fills traveller details for all passengers**
4. **Optionally adds seat & meals**
5. Optionally adds flexibility/insurance
6. Reviews policies and guidelines
7. Clicks "Proceed to Payment"
8. Validation occurs
9. Redirects to payment page

## Form Validation Messages

```javascript
❌ "Please fill all required traveller details"
❌ "Please provide contact email and phone number"
✅ Proceeds to payment
```

## Mobile Optimization

### Bottom Sticky Bar Features
- Shows total amount
- Quick CTA button
- Doesn't block content
- Auto-hides on scroll (optional)

### Form Optimization
- Single column on mobile
- Larger touch targets
- Proper keyboard types (email, tel, number)
- Date picker native controls

## Integration with Backend

### On Payment Click
```javascript
const bookingData = {
  flight: mockFlightData,
  travellers: travellerData,
  seat: selectedSeat,
  meals: selectedMeals,
  flexibility: selectedFlexibilityPlan,
  insurance: selectedInsurance
};

// Send to API
await createBooking(bookingData);
```

## Best Practices Implemented

✓ Visual feedback on completion
✓ Mobile-first responsive design
✓ Accessible form controls
✓ Clear section hierarchy
✓ Real-time fare updates

### Validation not working
Ensure all required fields have `*` indicator

### Sticky sidebar not working
Check scroll container and CSS `position: sticky`
