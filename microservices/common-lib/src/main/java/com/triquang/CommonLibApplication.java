/**
 * Marker class for the common-lib module.
 *
 * WHY this is NOT a @SpringBootApplication:
 * This module is a shared LIBRARY (DTOs, enums, utils), not a runnable service.
 * Libraries should not have:
 *   - @SpringBootApplication (starts an embedded web server — pointless for a library)
 *   - A main() method (nothing to "run")
 *   - spring-boot-maven-plugin (repackages JAR to executable format, breaking library usage)
 *
 * Other modules import this as a plain dependency:
 *   <dependency>
 *       <groupId>com.triquang</groupId>
 *       <artifactId>common-lib</artifactId>
 *   </dependency>
 *
 * You can delete this class entirely once you add real shared classes
 * (DTOs, enums, exceptions, etc.) to this package.
